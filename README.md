# 💹 Trading Dashboard – Self-Built React Project

A modern, responsive trading dashboard UI developed entirely from scratch using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **shadcn/ui**. I built this project independently to simulate the core layout of a real-world trading platform like Binance or CoinDCX.

The focus was on building a clean, professional, and scalable frontend from the ground up — no templates, no code generators, and no tutorials followed.

## 🧑‍💻 About This Project

I built this project solo to showcase my frontend skills in a real-world scenario. All JSX structure, component logic, and layout styling were implemented manually — no starter kits, AI tools, or UI template clones.

I referenced real trading apps for visual cues but wrote all code myself to understand how to:

- Manage layout structure with utility-first CSS
- Modularize UI elements for reusability
- Maintain responsiveness across screen sizes
- Design with scalability in mind for future API/data integrations
